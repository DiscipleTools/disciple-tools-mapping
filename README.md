# Disciple Tools - Network Dashboard
This plugin establishes a common system of mapping and tracking contacts and groups against population. The defaults
follow the shared network strategy of ZÃºme Project and 2414 Networks.

## Roles

This plugin is driven by two custom roles. 'Network Dashboard Viewer' and 'Network Dashboard Admin'. The 'viewer' can see the
dashboard and metrics; the 'Admin' can configure the plugin and make connections
