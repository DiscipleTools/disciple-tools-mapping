# Classification (Categories and Actions)
[Return to TOC](../README.md)

One challenge with consistent classification is POV ( point of view ). The same baptism can be reported
from the point of view of the spiritual journey of the baptized person, or the spiritual journey of 
the leader who has baptized someone. In traditional church with paid leadership, you expect the leader
to baptize as part of their job description, so the natural point of celebration is the individual who 
got baptized, but in a movement of non-professional followers of Jesus, whereas the one who is baptized 
is a blessing to celebrate, but the one who has been faithful to multiply their faith is a greater blessing 
to celebrate. So what POV do you report in the movement_log? The baptizee, the baptizer, or both?
