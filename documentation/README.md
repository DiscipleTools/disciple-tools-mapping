# Documentation for Network Dashboard

The Network Dashboard is a more complex plugin because it employed network architecture and many possible customizations
between site to site and multisite to multisite. So this documentation is being included, not just as a guide to the code,
but as a place to layout the network possibilities and best practices. (We might move it later, but here is a place to start it.)
